# Rapid Fire Open Source Project

## Introduction
The Rapid Fire Open Source Project delivers a high-quality and reliable solution for copying data while production is active. It's designed for scenarios where downtime must be minimized, such as in 24/7 operations.

## Problem Statement
Do you have files with **millions** or even **billions** of records? Imagine needing to add a new field to your data. You might have time to install this change over the weekend, but what if your operations run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? In such cases, it's critical to reduce the installation time to avoid prolonged system shutdowns.

## Solution: Rapid Fire
Rapid Fire addresses this challenge. With Rapid Fire, you can significantly reduce system downtime. Instead of shutting down your system for hours or days, Rapid Fire can reduce this to mere minutes.

## Features
Rapid Fire's features are driven by our ideas and needs. We encourage everyone to contribute with suggestions and manpower to enhance Rapid Fire's capabilities.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's feature suggestions, bug reports, or code contributions, your input is valuable to us.
